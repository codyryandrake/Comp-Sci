Desert Ruins
---------------------

In the North-West corner of of the map, a desert ruin lies smoldering in the sun. This part of the map contains multiple puzzle-levels built deeper and deeper into the Earth.

Consider these aspects of the Desert Ruins environment:

### Environment
Light, reflectivity, and perspective all play vital roles in these puzzles. **Take a screenshot of a reflective source in the Desert Ruins environment that doesn't involve a puzzle.**

### Material
Observe how the tint of the glass plate affects the color of the sky in this shot. **Take a screenshot of another element in the environment that seems to affect its surroundings.**

### Intuition
As you complete the glass factory's section of puzzles, consider how the melted glass affects your ability to solve the puzzle. **Did you change your problem-solving technique as the glass grew progressively distorted? If so, what did you do differently to solve it?**

### Bonus Puzzle
This puzzle can be found tucked away on the roof of the factory. **Jot down your current theory as to how these bonus puzzles work.**

Once you've completed the glass factory, follow the powered cord to Symmetry Island.

### Audiotape B1
The first puzzle section you encounter after taking a left through the first gate has an audiotape sitting on the ground next to it. **After listening to the tape, write down a brief reflection in response to what you heard.**

### Perspective
Many of the puzzles on Symmetry Island require you to re-orient your view of the environment in order to decipher the solution. **What strategies do you use to solve the puzzles when the solution is hidden from view?**

### Reflection
Reflection and symmetry play very important roles in many of the puzzles on this island. **When solving puzzles with symmetric control-lines, do you try to solve for one line at a time, or both simultaneously? Do you consider one control-line the original, and the other its reflection?**

### Audiotape B2
Just after passing through the second gate on the island hang left to find a side-path to a shaded area, and an audiotape resting on the ground. **After listening to the tape, write down a brief reflection in response to what you heard.**

### Lab Completion
This lab is complete when the final puzzle is solved and the laser fires from the top of Symmetry Island. Nice work!
